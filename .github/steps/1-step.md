## Step 1: Create a branch

Branches let you work on changes safely, without touching `main`.

### üìñ Theory: What is a branch?

A branch is a movable pointer to a sequence of commits. You can experiment freely, then merge your work back into `main` with a pull request.

### ‚å®Ô∏è Activity: Create `my-first-branch`

1. From the **Code** tab, open the branch dropdown (it likely shows `main`).
2. Type **`my-first-branch`** and select **Create branch**.
3. (Optional CLI)
   ```bash
   git checkout -b my-first-branch
   ```

Make sure you‚Äôre on the repository page, not your fork list.  
If using CLI, verify you have Git installed, `git --version`.
