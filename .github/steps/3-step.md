## Step 3: Open a pull request

A pull request (PR) proposes your changes and starts a review.

### 📖 Theory: Why pull requests?

PRs show a diff, enable code review, run checks, and keep `main` stable until your work is ready.

### ⌨️ Activity: Create your PR

1. Click **Compare & pull request** (or open the **Pull requests** tab → **New pull request**).
2. Base: **`main`** ← Compare: **`my-first-branch`**.
3. Add a clear title and a short description.
4. (Optional) Request a review from a teammate.

- If you don’t see the compare button, push your branch or ensure it has at least one commit.
- Double-check the base/compare branches are correct.
